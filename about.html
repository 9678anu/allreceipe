            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>Home cooks are heroes—it's as simple as that. Allrecipes is a community built by and for kitchen experts. The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to the baking project that a child dreamed up, the thrill-seekers who love to experiment with just about anything, and the doctor bakers for decadent weekend dessert. The enterprising who just want a solid recipe, without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night. Most importantly, Allrecipes connects home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration: each other. We believe that everyone deserves a seat at the table, and that inspires us to everything possible to keep our digital brand connected. Fifty-million home cooks deserve no less.</p>
            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1997 in Seattle, Allrecipes changed the food world by providing the tools to share recipes and cooking tips online. Since then, Allrecipes has become the world's largest community-driven food brand, providing trusted resources to more than 100 million cooks each month across web, mobile, and social platforms. In 2011, Allrecipes was acquired by Meredith Corporation, and in 2021, it became part of Dotdash Meredith. Today, Allrecipes continues to evolve with the world and cooks, creating content that provides authority, found nowhere else on the internet and has turned the brand into a global community of home cooks who share their beloved family recipes, create new recipes, and photograph, rate, and review each other's recipes. Each week, more than 15 million registered members add more than 2,000 recipe ratings, 800 new recipe photos, and almost 200 new recipes to the site. And every minute of every day, 27 people are saving recipes they love or want to try later.</p>
            <h2>Above all, we are</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Friendly: We love trading ideas and hanging out with fellow home cooks.</li>
                <li>Supportive: Struggling with dinner ideas? We're here to help!</li>
                <li>Creative: Cooking is an art. We like experimenting and express ourselves.</li>
                <li>Approachable: We don’t judge—all cooking levels and recipes are welcome.</li>
                <li>Down-to-Earth: We love good food, period. It doesn’t need to be fancy to be great!</li>
                <li>Fun: Life is fun, you enjoy friends, family, cooking, anything a good laugh.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="magazine">Allrecipes Magazine</h2>
            <p>The food industry's first large-scale digital-to-print brand extension, Allrecipes magazine launched in 2013. Now published six times a year, it reaches an audience of nearly 8 million. The magazine serves up a seasonal slice of recipes from the community, cooking tips, and trends, entertaining ideas, products, and more. It's for the love of cooking and eating — a major resource for all home cooks.</p>
            <h2 id="community">The Allrecipes Community</h2>
            <p>The heart of Allrecipes is our community of home cooks who share their beloved family recipes, create new recipes, and photograph, rate, and review each other’s recipes. Each week, more than 15 million registered members add more than 2,000 recipe ratings, 800 new recipe photos, and almost 200 new recipes to the site. And every minute of every day, 27 people are saving recipes they love or want to try later.</p>
            <h2 id="guidelines">Community Guidelines</h2>
            <p>We moderate every review and photograph added to a recipe. When leaving reviews, we ask that you (remember that a fellow Allrecipes community member has shared their recipe with you). Comments that are not welcome, but rude, mean, disrespectful, or spammy in nature are not welcome and will not be approved.</p>
            <h2 id="allstars">The Allrecipes Allstars</h2>
            <p>Social media influencers, registered dietitians, grillmasters, and more seasoned home cooks make up our enthusiastic squad of 100+ brand ambassadors. This diverse, food-loving crew spans the U.S. geographically and represents many different cultures, ethnicities, and family makeups. Since 2011, the Allrecipes Allstars have created tens of thousands of original recipes, photos, and reviews plus shared their cooking expertise via flat and video content on our website, social media, plus more marketing channels.</p>
            <h2 id="recipe-approval">Recipe Approval and Testing</h2>
            <h3>Kitchen-Approved Recipes</h3>
            <p>When Allrecipes’ readers add a recipe to the site, they may choose to save it as private, only share it on their profile page, or submit it for Kitchen Approved consideration. Recipes submitted to be Kitchen Approved are evaluated by our team of recipe editors, who ensure the usability and reliability of each recipe, and edit for Allrecipes style. Each recipe undergoes a series of reviews for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Duplication: Editors verify that the recipe doesn’t duplicate another that has already been published.</li>
                <li>Completion: The ingredient list is evaluated to be sure it is complete, that measurements are correct, and that ingredients are properly ordered and grouped according to their use.</li>
                <li>Accuracy: Serving sizes are checked for accuracy and to be sure that recipes reflect USDA dietary recommendations.</li>
                <li>Replication: Recipes are reviewed and edited to ensure they are replicable when following the instructions. Editors assess the techniques, equipment, and appliances used in the recipes, and explain any intermediate or advanced techniques with simple language and visuals.</li>
                <li>Health claims: Editors evaluate the use of any health or nutrition claims — such as healthy, low-carb, low-fat, or paleo — based on guidelines from the dieticians at our sister brand EatingWell.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once recipes are evaluated and edited, they are not only reliable but also compatible with our nutrition analysis, scaling, shopping list, and other recipe tools. Only the best recipes achieve Kitchen Approved status and get published and promoted.</p>
            <h3>Allrecipes Magazine Recipe Testing</h3>
            <p>Recipes selected for publication in Allrecipes magazine get further scrutiny and testing. Magazine recipes are tested once or four times in our test kitchens in Des Moines, Iowa, and Birmingham, Alabama. Trained test kitchen professionals prepare every recipe and then taste and evaluate it with recipe and story editors, confirming—and clarifying—all key components (including ingredient types and amounts, cooking procedures and times and temperatures, yields), and incorporate changes as needed to improve flavor, ease, and visual appeal.</p>
            <h2 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h2>
            <p>Our product reviews are independent and based on research and product testing — if you visit links within our content, we may earn commissions from your purchases, but we never receive any compensation for the content of our recommendations. Learn more about our review process.</p>
            <h2 id="editorial">Editorial Guidelines</h2>
            <p>At Allrecipes, we take great pride in the quality of our content. Our writers, photographers, and editors create original, accurate, and engaging content that reflects the interests and concerns of home cooks, and our recipe editors verify all user submissions before publication.</p>
            <h2 id="values">Our Values</h2>
            <p>Allrecipes believes everyone and every voice deserves a seat at the table. We want all home cooks to find dishes that represent their own culture or their heritage, and we strive to cultivate a community reflective of our readers’ varied backgrounds. That goes for our team, too! We engage writers, photographers, and recipe developers working in all types of cuisines. Our goal is to make room for everyone at the table as long as they share the secrets to grandma’s best recipe!</p>
